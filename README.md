## Relevant Points Open Education

If approved by the relevant authorities, several changes and improvement need to be made to the latest version of the exercises to attract the attention of potential users/students, here as some of them.

1. Make exercises and its content independent of the content and activities hosted in Canvas.
2. Integrate or make content independent of the 'video-lectures' when relevant. If opting for integration, the videos need to be edited to only include the parts that are relevant to the exercises and remove parts that are not useful for the online audiences (e.g., openings and answering questions from the audience).
3. Add an introduction chapter to frame the scope of the materials and for whom the material is relevant. Also, relate the course objective seamlessly (without the ITC jargon) to the context and content of the material.
4. Remove unnecessary rhetoric from the text.
5. Decide on dependency on the Living Textbook.
6. Host datasets outside Canvas.
