Resampling
==========


In data integration, **resampling** of images is an important pre-processing step, especially when we are dealing with datasets with different spatial resolutions and scales. When the differences in the spatial resolution between the input and the output are *small*, simple interpolation methods are good enough for estimating pixel values. However, when such differences are significant,  then we need to apply  *aggregation*.

The image you will be working on is a subset taken from band 1 of Landsat 5 sensor, and it has a pixel size of :math:`30 \ m`.


.. important:: 
   **Resources.**
   You will require the latest LTR version of `QGIS (A Coruna 3.10) <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html>`_, plus the dataset `resampling.zip <data_resampling_>`_ which you can download from CANVAS.  When you unzip the dataset, you will find the following files inside: 
  
   + ``l5_20100627_band1.tif`` -  an image subset from band 1 of Landsat 5 and spatial resolution of :math:`30 \ m`.
   + ``grid.shp`` - a vector dataset representing a grid for the original pixel size of the Landsat 5 image. 
   + ``average.txt`` - a file with a  kernel filter definition.
   + ``Resampling.qgs`` - a QGIS project file loaded with data layers and styles.


Task 1
   Make sure you have the **Map swipe tool** and **Value Tool** plugins installed.

Task 2 
   Configure QGIS to render layers using multiple CPU cores. Go to 
   :guilabel:`Settings` > :guilabel:`Options` > :guilabel:`Rendering` and make sure the option *Render Layers in parallel using many CPU cores* in on. Set :guilabel:`Max Cores` to the number of CPU cores in your computer, use at least 4 for better performance. See below.

Basic Resampling
------------------

Assume that we are going to use the Landsat image as input for a model. The model requires a grid size of :math:`50 \ m`. Thus we have to resample the image to a pixel size of :math:`50 \ m` before proceeding with the modelling. 



.. note:: 
   **Reflection.**
   In this section, we make the assumption that applying a resampling before the primary data processing operations (modelling in this case) is the correct procedure. *Note that in many cases it may be more accurate to process the image first and then do the resampling.*

   Read the details about resampling on the |ltb| `Geocoding`_ page. 


Resampling Techniques
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


 Task 3
   Start QGIS and open the *'Resampling'* project.
   From the :guilabel:`Processing toolbox`, open the tool **r.resamp.interp** and resample the image ``l5_20100627_band1.tif`` to :math:`50 \ m`. Use the **nearest** (neighbour) interpolation method. See :numref:`fig-resamp-interp-50`  Provide a self-descriptive name for the output file, for example: *nearest_50*

.. _fig-resamp-interp-50:
.. figure:: _static/img/resamp-interp-50.png
   :alt: resample 50 meter
   :figclass: align-center
   :scale: 75%

   The 'r.resamp.interp tool. Resampling to 50 m using the 'nearest' method

Task 4
   Repeat the previous task. This time use the **bilinear** and **bicubic** interpolation methods. Make sure to provide meaningful names for the outputs. For example: *bilinear_50*, and *bicubic_50* respectively.

.. attention:: 
   **Question.**
   Resampling relies on interpolation techniques, and therefore it depends on Toblerâ€™s first law of geography:  *locations that are closer together are more likely to have similar values than locations that are farther apart.* 
   
   Keeping that law in mind and look at the image below. It shows (for the pixel marked in red) which neighbouring pixels are considered in every interpolation technique.

   Can you think of a use case where one resampling techniques should be prefered over the others? Why? 

   .. image:: _static/img/resampling-techniques.png 
      :align: center


Task 5
   Copy the style of layer *'l5_20100627_band1'* and paste it on the *resampled* layers you created. To copy the style: :guilabel:`Right click`   on *'l5_20100627_band1'* > :guilabel:`Styles` > :guilabel:`Copy style`. See below. To paste the style: :guilabel:`Right click`   on the *layer where your want to paste the style* > :guilabel:`Styles` > :guilabel:`Paste style`. 


   .. image:: _static/img/copy-style.png 
      :align: center

Having the original and the resampled images with the same style will make it easier to compare the result of the different resampling techniques.



Comparing the Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should now have four raster layers in your project. The original *Landsat band 1*  and three additional images; the results from the resampling. See :numref:`fig-layers-panel-resampling`

.. _fig-layers-panel-resampling:
.. figure:: _static/img/layers-panel-resampling.png
   :alt: resampled layers
   :figclass: align-center

   Layers resulting from the resampling of  'l5_20100627_band1' using different techniques


.. note:: 
   **Reflection.**
   When resampling is applied to an image to produce a version with *lower resolution*, no new radiometric information is produced. That is resampling changes the pixel size, but it does not produce further information. On the contrary, resampling often implies a loss of information, and in the case of *lower resolution* a loss of spatial precision. Despite that, resampling is a technique that is required in many cases to integrated datasets with different spatial resolution. What should be carefully considered is if the loss of information and precision are acceptable for the analysis or not.    

Task 6
   Perform a visual comparison of the size and values of the pixels of the four raster layers. :guilabel:`Zoom` into to *'grid'* layer and explore the raster layers using the  **Value tool** and **Swipe map tool** plugins. Watch the video tutorial on `visually comparing rasters <https://player.vimeo.com/video/235504017>`_.

.. note:: 
   **Reflection.**
   Relate the differences you observe in *resampled layers* with the theory you learned in resampling and |ltb| `Geocoding`_.

Another way to compare the resampling results is by using a histogram. A histogram will show the differences in the distribution of the values.  To do this, we need to stack the individual resampling results in a single layer stack.

Task  7
   From the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox`, open the  **Build Virtual Raster** tool. 
   For :guilabel:`Input layers` select: *'l5_20100627_band1'*, *'nearest_50'*, *'bilinear_50'* and *'bicubic_50'*. Name the resulting stack as  **stack_50**. See :numref:`fig-build-virtual-raster`

.. _fig-build-virtual-raster:
.. figure:: _static/img/build-virtual-raster.png
   :alt: virtual raster layer
   :figclass: align-center

   Building a virtual raster stack with the resampled raster layers

Task 8
   Compute the histogram for all bands of the *'stack_50'* stack. :guilabel:`Right click` over  *'stack_50'* layer > :guilabel:`Properties` > :guilabel:`Histogram` > :guilabel:`Compute histogram`. You should see a histogram like the one below:

.. figure:: _static/img/histogram-stack50.png 
   :alt: virtual raster layer
   :figclass: align-center
   :scale: 80%
      

.. attention:: 
   **Question.**
   How do you explain the differences in the distribution of values in the histogram? Especially for *band 2* (nearest_50) and *band 4* (bicubic_50).


------------------------------

Advanced Resampling
--------------------------

For many practical applications, you have to resample an image to *much larger pixel sizes* than the original. In this section, you will resample the image to a  pixel size of :math:`200 \ m`. For the sake of comparison, you will use an **optimal** and a **sub-optimal** method.


Optimal Resampling: with Aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resampling an image to a *relatively larger pixel size* means that the **radiation** values, in the original image, must be integrated from a much larger surface area than the original. That is, for this case, to integrate the radiation values from an area of :math:`30 \ m \times 30 \ m`  to an area of :math:`200 \ m \times 200 \ m`. To do so, we first have to do an  *aggregation* (i.e. a convolution filter) and do the resampling only after that.

Task 9
   From the :guilabel:`Processing toolbox`, open the tool **r.mfilter**  and apply a  *low-pass kernel* of :math:`7x7`. Such kernel will average the data over a 7 by 7 pixels area, that is  :math:`30 \times 7 = 210  \ m`. Therefore, the kernel filter aggregate the radiation value for an area of :math:`210 \ m`   by :math:`210 \ m`.

   As :guilabel:`Input layer` choose *'l5_20100627_band1'* > for :guilabel:`Filter file` use the ``average.txt`` > for :guilabel:`Filtered` type ``average_7x7.tif`` > :guilabel:`Run`.  See :numref:`fig-rmfilter` 
   

.. _fig-rmfilter:
.. figure:: _static/img/rmfilter.png
   :alt: rm filter tool
   :figclass: align-center
   :scale: 75%

   Aggregation of radiation values using the 'r.mfiltr' tool


Task 10
   Use the **r.resamp.interp** tool and resample the ``average_7x7.tif`` to a pixel size of :math:`200 \ m`. Use the **nearest** interpolation method. Refer to Task 3 if you need to.


Sub-Optimal Resampling: no Aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To understand the reason why we should aggregate prior a resampling when the resampling resolution is  *much larger* than the original pixel size. Now, you will apply only a resampling of :math:`200 \ m` to the Lansat image.

Task 11
   Use the **r.resamp.interp** just like you did in the previous tasks. Use the *'l5_20100627_band1'* as input layer, **nearest** as interpolation method, and  :math:`200 \ m` for pixel size.

Comparing Optima and Sub-Optimal Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Task 12 
   Compare the *resampled* layers with and without aggregation. Use the technique you used in Task 6.

Task 13 
   Plot the histograms for the *resampled* layers with and without aggregation. If necessary, save the histogram(s) to a file so that you can look at both of them at the same time.

.. attention:: 
   **Question.**

   + When comparing the resampled images with and without aggregation. **Which one shows a â€˜smootherâ€™ image? Why?**
   + Which resampled images has a smaller value range? Why?
